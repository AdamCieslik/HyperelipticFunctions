The result of the inversion is defined only locally, and is done using the algebro-geometric techniques of the standard Jacobi inversion problem and the foregoing restriction to the θ -divisor. For a representation of the hyperelliptic functions the Klein–Weierstraß multivariable sigma function is introduced. It is shown that all parameters needed for the calculations like period matrices and Abelian images of branch points can be expressed in terms of the periods of holomorphic differentials and thetaconstants. The cases of genus 2 and genus 3 are considered in detail. The method is exemplified by particle motion associated with a genus 3 hyperelliptic curve.},

In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of ℘-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.},

	abstract = {In 1997 the present authors published a review (Ref. BEL97 in the present manuscript) that recapitulated and developed classical theory of Abelian functions realized in terms of multi-dimensional sigma-functions. This approach originated by K.Weierstrass and F.Klein was aimed to extend to higher genera Weierstrass theory of elliptic functions based on the Weierstrass \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-functions. Our development was motivated by the recent achievements of mathematical physics and theory of integrable systems that were based of the results of classical theory of multi-dimensional theta functions. Both theta and sigma-functions are integer and quasi-periodic functions, but worth to remark the fundamental difference between them. While theta-function are defined in the terms of the Riemann period matrix, the sigma-function can be constructed by coefficients of polynomial defining the curve. Note that the relation between periods and coefficients of polynomials defining the curve is transcendental. Since the publication of our 1997-review a lot of new results in this area appeared (see below the list of Recent References), that promoted us to submit this draft to ArXiv without waiting publication a well-prepared book. We complemented the review by the list of articles that were published after 1997 year to develop the theory of \${\textbackslash}sigma\$-functions presented here. Although the main body of this review is devoted to hyperelliptic functions the method can be extended to an arbitrary algebraic curve and new material that we added in the cases when the opposite is not stated does not suppose hyperellipticity of the curve considered.},
