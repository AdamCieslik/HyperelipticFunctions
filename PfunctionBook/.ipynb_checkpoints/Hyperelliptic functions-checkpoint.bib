In theta-functional representation of sigma-function the second group arises as periods of first and second kind differentials of the curve. We develop representation of periods in terms of theta-constants, for the first kind, period generalizations of Rosenhain type formulae are obtained whilst for the second kind, period theta-constant expressions are presented which are explicitly related to thefixed co-homology basis. We describe a method of constructing differentiation operators for hyperelliptic analogues ofζ- and \${\textbackslash}wp\$-functions on the parameters of the hyperelliptic curve. To demonstrate this method, we give the detailed construction of these operators in the case genus 1 and 2.},

	abstract = {Numerical tools for computation of \${\textbackslash}wp\$-functions, also known as Kleinian, or multiply periodic, are proposed. In this connection, computation of periods of the both first and second kinds is reconsidered. An analytical approach to constructing the Reimann surface of a plane algebraic curves of low gonalities is used. The approach is based on explicit radical solutions to quadratic, cubic, and quartic equations, which serve for hyperelliptic, trigonal, and tetragonal curves, respectively. The proposed analytical construction of the Riemann surface gives full control over computation of the Abel image of any point on a curve. Therefore, computation of \${\textbackslash}wp\$-functions on given divisors can be done directly. An alternative computation with the help of the Jacobi inversion problem is used for verification. Hyperelliptic and trigonal curves are considered in detail, and illustrated by examples. A method of finding the unique characteristic corresponding to the vector of Riemann constants is suggested for non-hyperelliptic and hyperelliptic curves.},
