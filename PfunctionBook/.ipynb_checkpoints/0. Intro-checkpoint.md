# Introduction

The notebook presented here is based on the work of Julia Bernatska {cite}`bernatska_computation_2024`. Additionally, I used an article posted on WolframCommunity {cite}`bernatska_Wolfram_2024` and the code attached to it: <em>AMap-CHyp-Exmpl1-Publ.nb</em>

The code is also based on the <em>SageMath Riemann surfaces</em> documentation  {cite}`Sage_documentation_riemann_nodate`

The general purpose of this Notebook is to present code that can compute the generalised Wierstrass $\wp_{ij}$ function (sometimes called Klein's functions) for a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2. test

````{prf:proof}
We'll omit the full proof.

But we will prove sufficiency of the asserted conditions.

To this end, let $y \in \mathbb R^n$ and let $S$ be a linear subspace of $\mathbb R^n$.

Let $\hat y$ be a vector in $\mathbb R^n$ such that $\hat y \in S$ and $y - \hat y \perp S$.

Let $z$ be any other point in $S$ and use the fact that $S$ is a linear subspace to deduce

```{math}
\| y - z \|^2
= \| (y - \hat y) + (\hat y - z) \|^2
= \| y - \hat y \|^2  + \| \hat y - z  \|^2
```

Hence $\| y - z \| \geq \| y - \hat y \|$, which completes the proof.
