# Preliminaries


Many works on hyperelliptic functions and Riemann surfaces use similar notation, which can lead to potential naming collisions. To avoid such collisions, a legend of notations used in this notebook is provided below.

## Legend

- $\mathscr{C}$ - an algebraic curve
- $X$ - a Riemann surface
- $\lambda_i$ - coefficients of the equation of $\mathscr{C}$
- $e_i$ - branch points
- $g$ - a genus of $\mathscr{C}$
- $du$ - first kind (or holomorphic) differential on $\mathscr{C}$ 
- $dr$ - second kind differential on $\mathscr{C}$
- $\mathfrak{a}_i, \mathfrak{b}_i$ - not normalised canonical homology cycles
- $\omega$ -  first kind integrals (first kind not normalised $\mathfrak{a}$, and $\mathfrak{b}$-period matrices)
- $\eta$ - second kind integrals (second kind not normalised $\mathfrak{a}$, and $\mathfrak{b}$-period matrices)
- $\mathrm{Jac}(\mathscr{C}) = \mathbb{C}^g/\{\omega, \omega' \}$ - Jacobian variety of the curve $\mathscr{C}$
- $D$ - Divisor  on the Riemann surface $X$
- $\mathcal{A}(P)$, $\mathcal{A}(D)$  - Abel image (or first kind integral) of a point $P$ and a divisor $D$
- $\Sigma$ - the theta-divisor defined by $\{ \mathbf{u}\in \mathrm{Jac}(\mathscr{C})| \sigma(\mathbf{u})=0 \}$
- $\mathfrak{U}(\mathscr{C})$ - differential field of $\wp$-functions on $\mathrm{Jac}(\mathscr{C}) \setminus \Sigma$
- $\mathbf{\varepsilon}$ - a characteristic vectors
- $\mathbf{K}$ - a vector of Riemann constants

## Hyperelliptic curve

In studies on hyperelliptic functions, various conventions for defining a curve, and consequently the hyperelliptic functions, can be found. In this notebook, we adopt the convention presented in {cite}`bernatska_computation_2024`, {cite}`bernatska_abelian_2024`and {cite}`bernatska_analogue_2024`.
  
Additionally, conventions for curves in both general and canonical forms are also discussed in dedicated notebooks: `canonical-name.ipynb` and `general-name.ipynb`. Please refer to these notebooks for further details.

:label: hyperelliptic_curve

The hyperelliptic curve is defined by the equation
```{math}
\mathscr{C} = \{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid f(x,y)=0 \},
``` 
where
```{math}
f(x,y) = -y^2 + x^{2g+1} + \sum_{i=0}^{2g}\lambda_{2i+2}x^{2g-i}, \quad \lambda_{k\leq0}=0,\; \lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}.
```  
````

```{note}
We assume $\lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}$, instead of $\lambda_k \in \mathbb{C}$ which can be found in various texts, because we would like to apply these functions to physical equations first.
