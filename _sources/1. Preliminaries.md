# Preliminaries


Many works on hyperelliptic functions and Riemann surfaces use similar notation, leading to potential collisions. To avoid this, I provide a legend of notations.

## Legend

- $\mathscr{C}$ - Curve
- $X$ - Riemann surface
- $e_i$ - branch points
- $w$ - An Abelian differential on the Riemann surface $X$
- $W$ - general Abelian integral
- $A$, $B$ - A- and B-periods of the differential $w=dW$   
- $du$ - First kind differential
- $dr$ - Second kind differential
- $dl$ - Third kind differential
- $\mathfrak{a}_i, \mathfrak{b}_i$ - Canonical homology cycles
- $\omega$ -  First kind integrals
- $\eta$ - Second kind integrals
- $\lambda$ - Third kind integrals
- $\mathcal{A}$ - Abel map
- $\mathfrak{m}(\mathbf{u})$ - A meromorphic function of $\mathbf{u}\in\mathbb{C}^g$
- $\Omega$ - Periodic matrices
- $\Lambda$ - Lattice
- $\mathrm{Jac}(\mathscr{C})$ - Jacobian variety of the curve $\mathscr{C}$
- $D$ - Divisor  on the Riemann surface $X$

Now we present the basic definitions

## Hyperelliptic curve

````{prf:definition}
:label: hyperelliptic_curve

The hyperelliptic curve is defined by the equation
```{math}
\mathscr{C} = \{ (x,y)\in \mathbb{C}^2 \mid f(x,y)= \},
``` 
where
```{math}
f(x,y) = -y^2 + x^{2g+1} + \sum_{i=0}^{2g}\lambda_{2i+2}x^{2g-i}, \quad \lambda_{k\leq0}=0,\; \lambda_0 =1, \; \lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}.
```  
````

```{note}
- We use convention from {cite}`bernatska_computation_2024`.
- We are working with physical equations where $\lambda_k \in \mathbb{R}$ instead of $\lambda_k \in \mathbb{C}$ which can be found in various texts. 
```
