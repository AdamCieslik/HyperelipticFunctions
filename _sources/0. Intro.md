# Introduction

The notebook presented here is based on the work of Julia Bernatska {cite}`bernatska_computation_2024`. Additionally, I used an article posted on WolframCommunity {cite}`bernatska_Wolfram_2024` and the code attached to it: <em>AMap-CHyp-Exmpl1-Publ.nb</em>

The code is also based on the <em>SageMath Riemann surfaces</em> documentation  {cite}`Sage_documentation_riemann_nodate`

The general purpose of this Notebook is to present code that can compute the generalised Wierstrass $\wp_{ij}$ function (sometimes called Klein's functions) for a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.
