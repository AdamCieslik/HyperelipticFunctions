# Introduction

Kleinian functions, also known as the generalised Wierstrass $\wp_{ij}$ functions, are important tools for studying hyperelliptic curves. The main objective of this notebook is to present code that can compute Kleinian functions for a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2.  While the primary focus is on the computation aspect, related concepts and background information are provided for context.
  
This notebook is based on the work of Julia Bernatska {cite}`bernatska_computation_2024` and the code attached to an article posted on WolframCommunity {cite}`bernatska_Wolfram_2024`. It also draws from the SageMath Riemann surfaces documentation <em>SageMath Riemann surfaces</em> documentation {cite}`Sage_documentation_riemann_nodate`. All additional references are listed in the Literature section at the end of the notebook.
